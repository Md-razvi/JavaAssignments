// How to create a class, object, method and its signature?

// Ans) A class in Java is a blue print for creating objects. IT defines properties and behavious of Object
// we can simply create a class as shown below by adding a class keyword and a class name as shown below
//Objects are instances of a class that allow us to access its properties and methods. 
//Example1 shows how objects are created
//Methods are set  of instruction that perform a particular task when they are called by a programmer . The concept of method is based on reusability and DRY(Dont repeat yourself) 
//Each method has a signature that is its type and arguments (values in the bracket). based on arguments we can also  use method with same name but multiple ways (Method Overloading)
//See Example 2 Where method Add of type int has been created 
//Main Class
public class Assign1{
    public static void main(String[] args){
      
        //Example 1
        Vehicle obj1=new Vehicle("Activa",2);
        Vehicle obj2=new  Vehicle("Toyota",4);      
        obj1.DisplayVehicleDetails();
        obj2.DisplayVehicleDetails();
        int result=obj1.Add(12, 15);
        System.out.println("The result is "+result);    
    }
      
    
    
}
class Vehicle{
    //Properties of a class 
     String brand;
     int wheel;
    //Assigning values to the properties    
    public Vehicle(String brand,int wheel) {
        this.brand=brand;
        this.wheel=wheel;
    }
    //Example 2
    public int Add(int a,int b){
            return a+b;
    
    }
    //displaying the values 
    public void  DisplayVehicleDetails(){
        System.out.println("This vehicle is a "+this.wheel+" wheeler of company "+this.brand);
    }     
}
